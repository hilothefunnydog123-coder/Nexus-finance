- "execution": how good and correct their final fixed version is.

Return ONLY valid raw JSON, no markdown, no backticks:

  "score": <integer 0-100, overall>,
  "verdict": "<punchy 3-5 word verdict>",
  "dimensions": { "detection": <0-100>, "reasoning": <0-100>, "execution": <0-100> },
  "flaws": [ { "flaw": "<short name, 6 words max>", "caught": <true|false> } ],
  "analysis": "<2-3 sentence expert analysis of their judgment on this challenge>",
  "nailed": "<one sentence on what they did genuinely well, or empty string>",
  "missed": "<one sentence on the most important thing they missed, or empty string>",
  "tip": "<one concrete sentence to sharpen their judgment next time>"
}
The "flaws" array must have exactly ${challenge.knownFlaws.length} items, one per hidden flaw, in order.`
