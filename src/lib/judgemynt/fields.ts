   Judgemynt — fields catalog (PUBLIC copy only).

   Each field is a career/subject track with its own curriculum of judgment
   challenges across three levels (Detect → Correct → Direct). This file holds
   ONLY what the browser may see — the brief and the flawed AI output. The
   hidden flaws + answer keys live server-side in /api/judgemynt/grade.

   Challenge ids are globally unique and double as the grade key, so adding a
   new field is just: append a JmField here + its answer keys in the route.

        original: "Social media is extremely harmful to teenagers. In fact, 73% of students say it ruins their grades, which proves it's dangerous. Everyone agrees that social media is bad because it is harmful to young people. That is why it should clearly be limited for all teens." },

It is the only man-made object visible from space with the naked eye, which shows how enormous it is. Honestly, summaries like this are always fun to write. It remains a major landmark today.' },
